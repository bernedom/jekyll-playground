In the past years, I have conducted numerous workshops and training sessions to help teams improve their software delivery processes and CMake skills. Here are some of the workshops I offer:

All workshops can be tailored to your team's needs, ranging from small 2h sessions to full-day or multi-day workshops. Topics include:
